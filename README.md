# Cities Skylines 2 : Worker Capacity Booster
Changes the calculation for commercial and industrial employment.
Worker count is higher at lower levels but leaves a level 5 building to be the same.
Offices however, also get a muliplier  boost for taller buildings by a power of 1.4
The larger difference is for office buildings which have much improved capacities vs vanilla.
Be prepared to funnel traffic towards smaller office regions.


## Instructions
No setting available, although that is something that can be added in the future.

### Safe to activate for existing cities
Existing building capacities are not affected. Only buildings that start their construction while the mod is active has their capacity changed.

### Safe to remove at any time
This mod is not required to load any saves made with it.  Saves made with this mod will work perfectly fine without it (workplace calculations have already been stored in the building data on creation). Future buildings will revert to the original calculation.

## Requirements
- BepInEx 5

## Installation
1. Make sure that BepInEx 5 is installed.
1. Place the `WG_HouseholdCapacityModifier` folder in the archive in your BepInEx `Plugins` folder.

## Misc

### Source code
[Available on GitHub](https://github.com/WhitefangGreytail/WG_HouseholdCapacityModifier) (
WhitefangGreytail/WG_HouseholdCapacityModifier).

Be wary of mods without publicly available source code, it's too easy to download executables from somewhere and find it has been changed. Even then, "Trust, but verify", would be the motto I would say here.

### Why even think about trusting me then?
Author of Realistic Population in Cities Skylines before handing it over to algernon-A. The repos in my GitHub still have them available for viewing.
I wanted to make this mod, primarily for myself. Did learn a few things about the corner I was interested in, comments in the code.
